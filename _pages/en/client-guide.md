# GC client user guide

Those purchasing code using the Micro-acquisition pilot must be an Employment and Social Development Canada or Service Canada employee.

Thank you for considering being part of this pilot and enabling small businesses and freelancers across the country to access GC contract dollars.

We think you will find some fantastic talent!

<div class="well"><h2 class="h5">Step 1</h2>
<p> Think you'd like to do a micro-acquisition?
Send us an <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">email</a> with some information about your coding needs.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 2</h2>
<p>Determine if your need meets the eligibility criteria for the pilot and whether the micro-acquisition pilot team has capacity to run your opportunity.  
For the pilot we have the capacity to run at least 10 micro-procurement opportunities.
If demand is greater that this we might not be able to meet that demand.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 3</h2>
<p>Write a description of the work required.
We have a template with instructions for how to do that.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 4</h2>
<p>Reserve the funds and post the bilingual opportunity on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/opportunities.md %}" title="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> page.</p>

<p><em>Note: to post your opportunity, you will open a Pull Request on the Micro-Acquisition repository (on GitHub).
If you don't know how to do this, no problem! We can coach you through it. Send us an <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">email</a>.</em></p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 5</h2>
<p>Evaluate the suppliers who express an interest in your opportunity based on the evaluation criteria included in your opportunity statement.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 6</h2>
<p>Select a supplier. Then the work begins on an open repository such as <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a> (bilingual), <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> GitHub</a> (English only), <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a> (English only).</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 7</h2>
<p>Assess the delivered code against the acceptance criteria included in the opportunity statement.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 8</h2>
<p>If the code meets the acceptance criteria you accept the code. Then the supplier is paid by credit card.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 9</h2>
<p>Add an entry for the delivered code in the <a href="https://code.open.canada.ca/en/index.html" target="_blank">Open Resource Exchange</a> so others can find and reuse the code.</p>
