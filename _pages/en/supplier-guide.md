# Supplier user guide

Applying to an opportunity?  You'll need the following:

- An account on an open repository. You can work on a repository of your choice. Some repository options include [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up) (bilingual), GitHub (english only), [Bitbucket](https://id.atlassian.com/signup?application=bitbucket&continue=https%3A//bitbucket.org/account/signin/%3Foptintocst%3D1%26next%3D/%3Faidsignup%3D1) (english only)

- Familiarity with git *add a link to a bilingual user guide*

- To be able to accept payment from a credit card using a payment system or via PayPal. Note that having a credit card does not mean you are able to accept payment by credit card. Learn about how to get set up to accept credit cards using a payment system *add a link to some info about this - is there an open source option?* and [get set up to accept payment via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/ca/business/get-paid?kid=p42863580764&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyoeCBhCTARIsAOfpKxhGE1kaeCjl6C4w_xMLIHHGw-EWc9FgPpFUvZXgjFzH81ptH4MTBEgaAoYHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).

If you have a question about an opportunity, get them in as fast as possible, answers to these questions need to be posted on the website for everyone so we canâ€™t except questions with less than 24 hours to an opportunity closing.

Anticipate questions and include the answers in the documentation (advice from OSME)
