This guide provides information for applicants applying on micro-acquisition coding opportunities. On this page, applicants can find information on eligibility, how to apply, receiving payment and contact information.  

## Are you eligible?

You are eligible for opportunities on this site if:

- you are Canadian and/or First Nations, Métis, Inuit or
- you have the appropriate <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit.html" target="_blank"> work permit(s) </a> to work in Canada.

<h2>Before you apply, you need:</h2>

### 1. An account on a public source code repository

You can work on a repository of your choice.
Some repository options include <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank"> GitLab </a> (bilingual), <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub </a> (English only), <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a>(English only).

### 2. Familiarity with Git version control system

If you have not used Git before or need a refresher, this <a href="https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet" target="_blank"> Git cheat sheet </a> includes all the basic commands.

### 3. The ability to accept payment from a credit card using a payment system or via PayPal

If you choose to use a payment system, it must accept payment via Visa card.
If you would like to accept payment via PayPal, visit <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ca/business/get-paid?kid=p42863580764&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyoeCBhCTARIsAOfpKxhGE1kaeCjl6C4w_xMLIHHGw-EWc9FgPpFUvZXgjFzH81ptH4MTBEgaAoYHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">how to get set up to accept PayPal payment </a>.  

*Note: simply having a credit card does not mean you are able to accept payment by credit card.*

**You will need all three of these things to work on a micro-acquisition contract.**

If you need clarification on the details of an open opportunity before applying, please email your question(s) to <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca</a>.

If you have a question about an open opportunity, send it to us as fast as possible. Answers to these questions are posted on the website for everyone. Questions may be submitted up until two business days before an opportunity closes.

## Are you ready to apply?

When you apply to micro-acquisition opportunities by <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">email</a>, please include the following information:

- The name of the opportunity you are applying for
- Your name
- Your business name (if different from your name)
- Responses to all of the Evaluation Criteria
- One of the following written statements:

  1. I affirm that I am Canadian and/or First Nations, Métis, Inuit or
  2. I affirm that I have all the relevant work permits to work in Canada

Note: evaluation criteria are marked as a pass/fail (there is no scoring). **A pass is required for each evaluation criteria in order for you to be considered for an opportunity.**
 
We encourage you to apply to other opportunities that may interest you.  

<div class="well">By applying to an opportunity, you agree to:

<ul><li>complete the work by the completion date in the opportunity statement; and</li>
<li>be paid by credit card (Visa) or PayPal </li></ul></div>

## After you apply

Once the opportunity selection date closes, applications are evaluated.
If multiple suppliers pass the evaluation criteria, we assign a number to those suppliers.
Then, we use a random number generator to select the winning supplier from this group.  


You will be advised by email whether you *have* or *have not* been selected. **If you are not selected, you may contact us to request a debrief.**

## Work and payment

If you are selected, you will be asked to sign a *terms and conditions document* before the work is started. This is the  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/terms.md %}" title="Terms and Conditions">template terms and conditions </a>  document that will be used for all micro-acquisition opportunities. Once this document is signed, you are put in contact with the client.  
 
Once the work is complete, it is assessed against the Work Acceptance Criteria. 

If the work *does not meet* the Work Acceptance Criteria in the opportunity statement, you will have the opportunity to revise your work. With that in mind, we recommend that you deliver your work in advance of the deadline to allow time for any revision necessary.  

If the work *does meet* the Work Acceptance Criteria in the opportunity statement, you send an invoice for the fixed price of the opportunity, plus any applicable taxes to <a href="mailto:NA-FPS-SFA-GD@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.">NA-FPS-SFA-GD@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.</a>   
You may use your own invoice template if you have one.   
 

We have an  [ invoice template ](../../assets/invoice_template.odt) if you need one. It includes all the fields required for payment.  

<!-- If you are selected, you will be asked to sign <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/terms.md %}" title="Terms and Conditions">terms and conditions document</a> before you start the work (the document will be sent to you already filled in).

Once your work has been completed and the client agrees that the work meets the acceptance criteria in the opportunity statement, you will send an invoice for the fixed price of the opportunity plus any applicable taxes.

You can use [this template invoice](../../assets/invoice_template.odt). It includes all the fields required for payment. -->
