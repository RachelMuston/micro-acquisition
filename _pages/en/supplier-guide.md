# Supplier user guide

## Are you eligible?

You are eligible for opportunities on this site if:

- you are Canadian and/or First Nations, Métis, Inuit or
- you have the appropriate [work permit(s)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit.html) to work in Canada.

<h2>Before you apply, do you have:</h2>

### 1. An account on a public source code repository

You can work on a repository of your choice.
Some repository options include [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (bilingual), [GitHub](https://github.com.com/) (English only), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (English only)

### 2. Familiarity with Git version control system

If you have not used Git before or need a refresher, this [Git cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet) includes all the basic commands.

### 3. The ability to accept payment from a credit card using a payment system or via PayPal

If you choose to use a payment system, it must accept payment via Visa card.
If you would like to accept payment via PayPal but are not sure how, instructions for [how to get set up to accept payment](https://www.paypal.com/ca/business/get-paid?kid=p42863580764&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyoeCBhCTARIsAOfpKxhGE1kaeCjl6C4w_xMLIHHGw-EWc9FgPpFUvZXgjFzH81ptH4MTBEgaAoYHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) can be found on the Paypal website.  

*Note that simply having a credit card does not mean you are able to accept payment by credit card.*

**You will need all three of these things to work on a micro-acquisition contract.**

## Got questions?

If you need clarification on the details of an open opportunity before applying, please email your question(s) to <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca</a>.

If you have a question about an open opportunity, send it to us as fast as possible. Answers to these questions are posted on the website for everyone. Unfortunately we can't accept or answer questions if they are received less than 2 business days before an opportunity closes.

## Ready to apply?

When you apply to Micro-Acquisition opportunities by <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">email</a>, please include the following information:

- The name of the opportunity you are applying for
- Your name
- Your business name (if different from your name)
- Responses to all of the Evaluation Criteria
- One of the following written statements:

  1. I affirm that I am Canadian and/or First Nations, Métis, Inuit or
  2. I affirm that I have all the relevant work permits to work in Canada

Note that the evaluation criteria are marked as a pass/fail.
You will not be given a score for each criteria.
**A pass is required for each criteria in order to be considered for an opportunity.**

<div class="well">By applying to an opportunity, you agree to:

<ul><li>complete the work by the completion date in the opportunity statement, -and</li>
<li>be paid by credit card or PayPal </li></ul></div>

## After you apply

Once the opportunity deadline has passed, the applications will be evaluated.
If multiple suppliers pass the evaluation criteria, we will assign a number to those suppliers.
Then, we will use a random number generator to select the winning supplier from this group.

You will be advised by email whether you *have* or *have not* been selected.

## Your work and payment

If you are selected, you will be asked to sign [a terms and conditions document](terms.md) before you start the work (the document will be sent to you already filled in).

Once your work has been completed and the client agrees that the work meets the acceptance criteria in the opportunity statement, you will send an invoice for the fixed price of the opportunity plus any applicable taxes.

You can use [this template invoice](../../assets/invoice_template.odt). It includes all the fields required for payment.
