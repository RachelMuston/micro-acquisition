# How the Micro-acquisition process works

<div class="well"><h2 class="h5">Step 1</h2>
<p> An ESDC team with a coding opportunity gets in touch with the Micro-Acquisition team via <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca" target="_blank">email</a>  to discuss their coding needs.

<h2 class="h5">Step 2</h2>
<p>The Micro-Acquisition team determines if that team's coding need meets the eligibility criteria for the pilot and if the micro-acquisition pilot team has capacity to run the opportunity.  
For the pilot we have the capacity to run at least 10 micro-procurement opportunities.
If demand is greater than this we might not be able to meet that demand.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 3</h2>
<p>The ESDC team writes a description of the work required.
We have a template with instructions for how to do that.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 4</h2>
<p>The ESDC team reserves the funds and posts the bilingual opportunity on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/opportunities.md %}" title="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> page.</p>

<p><em>Note: to post an opportunity, ESDC teams will open a Pull Request on the Micro-Acquisition repository (on GitHub).
If you don't know how to do this, no problem! We can coach you through it. Send us an <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca" target="_blank">email</a>.</em></p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 5</h2>
<p>The ESDC team evaluates the suppliers who expressed an interest in the opportunity using the evaluation criteria included in the opportunity statement.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 6</h2>
<p>The ESDC team selects a supplier. Then the work begins on an open repository such as <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a> (bilingual), <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> GitHub</a> (English only), <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a> (English only).</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 7</h2>
<p>The ESDC client assesses the delivered code against the acceptance criteria included in the opportunity statement.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 8</h2>
<p>If the code meets the acceptance criteria the ESDC team will accept the code. Once the code is accepted, the supplier sends an invoice and the supplier is paid by credit card.</p>

<h2 class="h5">Step 9</h2>
<p>The ESDC team adds an entry for the delivered code in the <a href="https://code.open.canada.ca/en/index.html" target="_blank">Open Resource Exchange</a> so others can find and reuse the code.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/supplier-guide.md %}" title="Supplier Guide">Supplier Guide</a> with more detailed information including things like eligibilty criteria and getting set up to accept credit card payment.</p>

<p>For ESDC teams who are interested in Micro-Acquisition, we have a detailed guide for ESDC teams available on request. Send us an <a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca" target="_blank">email!</a>  For the pilot, those purchasing code using the Micro-acquisition pilot must be an Employment and Social Development Canada or Service Canada employee.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering being part of this pilot and enabling small businesses and freelancers across the country to access GC contract dollars.</p>

<p>We think you will find some fantastic talent!</p>
