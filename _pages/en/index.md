# Welcome to the Micro-Acquisition website

Are you a developer/programmer and you would like to earn some money working on short government contracts?
Then you have come to the right place!

**Check out the [Opportunities]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/opportunities.md %}) page** to see if there are any open opportunities that meet your skills.

More information about how Micro-Acquisition works can be found in the [Supplier user guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/supplier-guide.md %}) page.

## How is this different from other government of Canada procurement processes

- **The application process is easy.** Our goal is that you will be able to apply in 2 hours or less.
- **You will be paid quickly.** We are using credit cards/PayPal for payment to ensure you do not have to wait long once you have delivered your code.
- **Fewer barriers in your way.** All the work is unclassified which means it can be done from your home on your computer and you do not need to have completed a government security screening.

Are you an Employment and Social Development Canada employee who has work packages that could be done by external developers?
Send us an email (add link) and we can help you get the process started.
Information about what you'll need to do can be found in the [Client user guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/en/client-guide.md %}) page.

## What is Micro-Acquisition

This is a pilot project being run for one year out of Employment and Social Development Canada through a partnership between the Innovation Information Technology Branch and the Chief Financial Officer Branch.

On this web site you will find opportunities for programming work which meet the following criteria:

- delivered code must be licensed as open source
- contract value of $10K or less
- all work is unclassified

## Gratitude

This pilot would not have been possible without the help of the kind folks at the [BC Developers Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/)/[BC Digital Marketplace](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace) who have lead the way for years, and from the wonderful people at the Office of Small and Medium Enterprises who have generously shared their expertise.
We have also endeavoured to learn from the lessons of the [GC Developers Exchange](https://github.com/canada-ca/devex) (the Government of Canada's first foray into low dollar value acquisitions for open source code).
