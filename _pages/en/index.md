<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-lg">Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is looking for coders that can create and deliver custom code under an open source license.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-lg">These work opportunities are low dollar value ($10K or less) and involve the use of <a href="https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/esc-src/protection-safeguarding/niveaux-levels-eng.html" target="_blank">unclassified, non-protected information</a> only (so security clearance is not required).</p>

<p>Contribute to increased working in the open and reuse of code in the Government of Canada!</p>

<h2>How is this different from other Government of Canada procurement  opportunities?</h2>
<p>Our goal is to make the process simpler for you from start to finish by:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;  text-indent: -45px; margin-left:100px;">
<li> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-send" style="font-size: 2em; margin: 0 4rem 1rem 0;"> </span><strong> Easier application process.</strong> Complete and submit your application in 2 hours or less.</li>
<p></p>
<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-repeat" style="font-size: 2em; margin: 0 4rem 1rem 0;"> </span> <strong> Quick selection turnaround.</strong> The evaluation of applications for an opportunity is fast and light-touch. We anticipate announcing the winning supplier two business days following the closing of an opportunity.</li>
<p></p>
<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" style="font-size: 2em; margin: 0 4rem 1rem 0"> </span> <strong> Fewer hurdles to winning opportunities.</strong> No lengthy pre-approval processes, anonymized evaluation process to reduce bias and all work is done virtually so an NCR location is not required. </li>
<p></p>
<li><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-usd" style="font-size: 2em;  margin: 0 4rem 1rem 0"> </span> <strong>Faster payment.</strong> Deliver your code and receive your payment by credit card or PayPal.</li>

## About this pilot

<p>This micro-acquisition pilot project is being run for one year at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html" target="_blank">Employment and Social Development Canada</a> through a partnership between the Innovation Information Technology Branch and the Chief Financial Officer Branch.</p>

<p>This pilot would not have been possible without the help of the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/" target="_blank">BC Developers Exchange</a>/<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace" target="_blank">BC Digital Marketplace</a> who have lead the way for years, and from the <a href="https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/pme-sme/index-eng.html" target="_blank">Office of Small and Medium Enterprises</a> who have generously shared their expertise.
We have also endeavoured to learn from the lessons of the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/devex" target="_blank">GC Developers Exchange</a> (the Government of Canada's first foray into low dollar value procurement of open source code).</p>

<p><a href="mailto:microacquisition@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">Contact us</a> if you are an ESDC team with a coding opportunity!</p>
